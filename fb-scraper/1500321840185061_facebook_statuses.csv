1500321840185061_1740476682836241,"A while back I posted a pitch that said ""Harambe: the Musical"".
So I decided to start writing the opening number.
Tell me what you think:

How does a primate, simian, 
Son of a chimp and a monkey,
Dropped in the middle of a forgotten zoo 
in Cincinnati, Ohio trapped in poverty and squalor,
somehow take bullets from its human fathers?

The 17-year-old, Western lowland gorilla, who was shot and slaughtered
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
by being a lot smarter
by being one sentence pitch starter.
In twenty sixteen, everybody posted all about him.

And every day while kids
Went to the zoo to see what animals did
A kid fell in and struggled to get his guard up.
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
But our brother grabbed the kid and started to drag him off.

Then the zoo staff came, and devastation rained
Our ape, would see his future drip, dripping down the drain.
The zookeeper took a gun, and aimed it at his brain.
And then there was a bang, but the gorilla felt no pain!

And the word got around, they said
this shooting is insane man!
He travelled through the internet and all the way to meme-land!
Get yo' face on t-shirts!
Don't forget from whence you came!

And the World's gonna know your name.
What's yo name man?

Harambe, the 17-year-old, Western lowland gorilla.
My name is Harambe, the 17-year-old, Western lowland gorilla.
And I was shot by zookeepers with guns.

Instead of working with NGOs, this event encourages students to read in detail case studies and other govt provided data and have a thorough knowledge and awareness about the problems faced by rural India. Participants are expected to go through the various policies by the Govt of India which are rolled out for the development of rural areas. With their own understanding of the problem along with the currently present solutions/policies, participants should work on an optimal solution.

We are organizing a National youth campus connect programme and want to associate with you for the same.We are open to cash or kind association.
The Campus connect presents a unique opportunity for brands to register themselves as in the minds of their target audience in a novel way. Not only does campus connect present a continued brand recall for over 3 months that spans over 300 colleges of Delhi NCR across 3 major universities of Delhi region, the Delhi University, the Indraprastha University and the Amity University along with other private colleges and universities, reaching out to more than 10,00000 students of the region. The expanse of the entire exercise makes it possible for a brand to customize communication and still keep its general reach intact.
Brands that wish to reach out to the targeted audience can partner us in a mutually beneficial outreach effort.
I'm hoping we could talk about it more in detail and in person.
In anticipation of a positive response.

Of course, there is a caveat. Our new boss believes in vertical synergy, where ideas from the top down should be united in corporate brand togetherness. They're excited about the proposals you guys are going to make, but we must dictate that all pitches me ones that the companies owned by Elon Musk can carry out.

Thank you all for participating in the FIRST OSSP FOCUS GROUP SPECIAL SPACETIME EVENT! (FYI, though we're calling it the FIRST OSSP special event, due to troubles RE: quantum physics, probability, time-dilation, there was a brief moment where we traveled through all OSSP special events at the same time and ultimately obliterated ""One Sentence Startup Pitches Does The Old West"" in our tachyon wake.

You may now feel free to go back to brainstorming ideas for our current epoch. This was awesome and you guys were all brilliant, hilarious, and EXCEPTIONALLY SYNERGY.

Note: Though we're in 2014, you should feel free to post your OSSP 3000 ideas in this group as if it were still the year 3000. Simply open it with the tag [Meanwhile, in the Future...] or [3000]

I'm a survivor/warrior, artist, author, writer, health advocate, actress, and playwright. I'm also a 28-year-old college kid and a very happy, grateful newlywed.   I've ""thrived"" after a coma, organ failure, sexual abuse, 27 surgeries, six years unable to eat or drink and the PTSD that comes from ten years of trauma.  To heal, I created a one-woman musical about it, ""Gutless & Grateful,"" which explores themes of resilience, post-traumatic growth, and much, much, much unwavering hope and optimism. You can read a bit about my own journey here: https://www.amyoes.com/2015/08/09/how-losing-my-stomach-made-me-hungry-for-life/ and there is also a brief documentary on my story in the link.  I'm also touring college campuses with a mental health awareness/sexual assault prevention program - https://www.amyoes.com/gutless/for-colleges/  My goal is to lead a retreat/online summit to help others thrive and cultivate resiliency.    I also do private coaching and workshops.",Amy Oestreicher,How Losing My Stomach Made Me Hungry For Life,link,https://www.amyoes.com/2015/08/09/how-losing-my-stomach-made-me-hungry-for-life/,2016-01-10 20:36:40,32,19,0,32,0,0,0,0,0

1500321840185061_1621445651406012,"My fellow synergistic dog-focused innovators,

A year ago, I was bored, and, hoping to spend a couple of hours posting ridiculously silly things with some friends, I typed ""One Sentence Startup Pitches"" into the create group feature, threw ""PORN FOR DOGS"" behind Bill Gates, and invited 30 friends. I didn't expect it to last more than five hours.

By the end of the day, we had 160 members, many of whom I didn't know, and all of whom seemed to be posting ""for dogs"" in response to anything I wrote.

It is now a year later. We now have 7361 members, we have appeared in  news stories and blog posts (http://observer.com/2014/11/dog-focused-thinktank-demands-credit-after-dogvacays-secures-25-million-in-funding/), and — this is what I'm most proud of — we have not managed to conceive a single viable startup idea that actually made it to production.

Today is August 18th. Today is our first birthday. I can't thank you all enough for making my life so weird. 

All we need is $50,000 for this group to really take off.",Nicky Dover,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204513943792572&set=gm.1621445651406012&type=3,2015-08-18 21:52:34,560,43,2,560,0,0,0,0,0
