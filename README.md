# One Sentence Startup Pitches Bot

## Overview
@osspbot is a Twitter bot that posts procedurally generated One Sentence Startup Pitches. It scrapes the One Sentence Startup Pitches group on Facebook to obtain a large dataset for Markov analysis, then uses a custom-designed “middle-out” Markov Chain to generate a setup and punchline around predefined pivot words.

@osspbot is made with the Tweepy library for Python and my forked version of [Facebook Page Post Scraper by Minimaxir](https://github.com/borrascador/facebook-page-post-scraper)
