My
fellow
disruptors,
I
am
so
proud
to
be
here
today
to
announce
the
end
of
our
second
fiscal
year.
HOLY
SHIT,
WE'RE
TWO.
Despite
tremendous
changes
to
the
meme
climate,
we've
managed
to
grow
138%,
outstripping
all
of
our
competitors,
including
TechCrunch
Disrupt,
Slashdot,
and
Gawker.
With
this
growth,
we
now
qualify
for
UNICORN
STATUS.
And
most
importantly,
during
this
time
we
have
completely
and
utterly
changed
the
way
that
technology
operates,
with
tremendous
advances
across
all
verticals,
and
the
latest
example
happened
just
today,
where
through
our
efforts,
private
prisons
were
finally
banned.
I'm
proud
of
all
of
us.
There's
still
work
to
be
done.
The
vast
majority
of
mobile
applications
still
remain
inaccessible
to
dogs,
despite
the
advent
of
VR,
and
dogs
remain
horribly
underrepresented
on
board
seats.
The
Blue
Engine
looms,
defeated
but
undead.
And
despite
our
best
efforts,
our
birthday
posts
continue
to
be
longer
than
one
sentence.
These
are
goals
I'm
confident
we
can
overcome.
But
today,
we
let
our
fur
down.
From
now,
until
judgment
at
the
end
of
September,
we
will
be
holding
a
COMPETITION.
For
all
of
those
interested
in
participating,
the
goal
is
this:
Take
your
favorite
OSSP
post,
and
develop
it
into
a
video
pitch
elevator
pitch/shark
tank
style/kickstarter
style/infomercial
style
-
whatever
you
want.
At
the
end,
the
videos
will
be
judged,
and
the
winners
honored
on
this
page.
Mods
are
available
to
answer
any
questions
regarding
the
competition.
Thank
you
all
for
participating
in
this
wonderful
fiscal
year.
Your
weirdness
drives
this
company,
but

also
drives
my
heart.

fell
in

But
our

would
see

drip,
dripping
down

took
a

got
around,
they
said
this
shooting
is

travelled
through

the
way
to

https://www.facebook.com/events/1228500317161204/
This
is
the
first
national
event
of
it's
kind.
Our
mission
ensures
we
will
reduce
the
number
of
average
daily
suicides
from
23x
Veterans
per
day,
to
18,
in
a
matter
of
5-years.
Check
your
feelings
of
FREEDOM,
not
now,
right
NOW.
If
you
feel
patriotic
toward
the
men
and
women
who
travel
the
earth
on
the
World
Freedom
Tour,
then,
JoinUS.
The
United
States,
ARMY,
NAVY,
AIR
FORCE
and
MARINES
are
SUFFERING
from
23x
SELF-INDUCED
CAUSALITIES
per/DAY
because
our
enforcers
return
home
to
find
a
new
battlefield
in
the
mind
where
any
moment
could
tip
balance
between
LIFE
or
death.
JoinUS
at
23:23:00
hours
on
Veterans'
Day
to
honor
the
previously
unmentionable
and
forgotten
brothers
plus
sisters
who
are;
broken,
homeless
and/or
not
feeling
their
best.
Next,
take
ONE
second
to
honor-the-struggle
of
those
in
battle
who
refuse
to
loose
and
choose
not
to
snooze.
Your
demonstrated
support
for
EVERY
MILITARY
PERSON
will
help
us
gain
the
momentum
we
need
to
reduce
the
number
of
suicides
by
introducing
new
wellness
reform
protocols
at
the
Veterans
Administration.
ONE
veteran
per
day,
every
day,
until
we
are
saving
TWO
per
day,
then
THREE,
FOUR,
FIVE,
then
MORE.
Have
you
ever
made
such
a
big
difference
in
the
absence
of
physical
effort?
JoinUS
because
you
truly
cherish
the
people
of
the
USA
who
volunteer
in
this
great
land
to
provide
you
the
one
thing
that

guys
are

make,

must

ones
that

by

can
carry
out.

pitch
such
as

for

the

will
be
met
with
money,
praise,
and
dog
treats.

I'm
a

I'm
also
a
28-year-old

I've
thrived
after
a
coma,
organ
failure,
sexual
abuse,
27
surgeries,
six
years
unable
to
eat
or
drink
and
the
PTSD
that
comes
from
ten
years
of
trauma.
To
heal,
I
created
a
one-woman
musical
about
it,
Gutless
&
Grateful,
which
explores
themes
of
resilience,
post-traumatic
growth,
and
much,
much,
much
unwavering
hope
and
optimism.

typed

attempted

who
are
so
lazy
that
they
can't
even
be
bothered
to
decide
what
food
they
want
stoners,
so
you
just
enter
a
price
range
and
hit
a
button
and
the
app
would
order
it
and
hit
your
credit
card
for
it
and
have
it
delivered,
and
this
isn't
a
pun
or
anything
i
just
think
it
was
a
great
app
idea,
but
it
feels
really
weird
to
post
a
non-pun
pitch,
but
i
have
to
keep
this
down
to
one
sentence
so
i
guess
i
can't
really
reflect
on
that
much
without
really
stretching
the
definition
of
sentence
farther
than
it
deserves
to
be
stretched.

of

Today,
less
than
a
week
from
our
first
anniversary,
we
mods
found
ourselves
facing
our
greatest
threat
yet.
I
am
of
course
speaking
of
a
train,
whose
name
is
now
unutterable.
This
train
caused
us
to
build
a
monstrosity,
a
terrifying
device
capable
of
utter
destruction.
We
built
a
machine,
and
trained
it
to
be
obedient
to
us.
We
trained
it
then
to
destroy
all
posts
that
uttered
the
abhorrent
name.
Yes,
we
saved
the
group,
but
at
what
cost?
Look
upon
the
names
of
the
vanquished.
Some
iterations
of
his
name
were
reposted
again
and
again.
Look
at
the
reposts.
Is
this
what
has
become
of
us?
Let
us
hope
that
we
never
have
to
use
such
a
weapon
again,
and
that
OSSP
can
instead
live
in
synergy
and
dogliness.

created.

Customers:
A
company
has
taken
up
a
large
minority
stakeholder
position
within
OSSP.
They
have
succeeded
in
pushing
the
majority
of
our
shareholders
to
vote
for
a
strategic
repositioning
of
our
company.
The
company
is
gerbiltees.biz.
Their
strategic
repositioning
can
be
summed
up
as
follows:
DOGS
AND
CATS
TOO
BIG.
We
will
now
be
a
gerbil-focused
thinktank
and
startup
incubator.
gerbiltees.biz
has
appointed
Kirsten
Madsen,
Chief
Gerbil
Officer
of
gerbiltees.biz,
to
our
board
of
administrators
to
facilitate
in
the
transition.
How
will
this
affect
you:
-For
now,
everything
will
remain
the
same,
with
the
exception
that
all
pitches
will
be
for
gerbils,
not
for
dogs.
Dogs
and
cats
are
now
too
big.
-As
we
move
into
the
future,
we
will
begin
phasing
in
mandatory
gerbil
tees
as
uniforms
for
all
OSSP
members.
This
will
be
accomplished
as
our
members
are
slowly
transformed
from
dogs
to
gerbils.
We
thank
you
for
your
patronage,
and
hope
you
appreciate
the
new
direction.

Hello
One
Sentence
Startup
Pitches,
This
post
is
being
repinned
as
we
prepare
to
transition
back
to
our
original
strategy
of
dog-focused
innovation.
While
our
gerbil
products
have
gained
significant
traction
in
certain
markets,
we
have
found
that
gerbil
based
startups
are
hard
to
upscale
as
upscaled
startups,
like
dogs
and
cats,
are
too
big.
Please
be
advised
that
neither
your
position
within
OSSP
nor
your
mammal
status
will
change.
Over
the
next
few
weeks,
you
will
begin
to
see
some
changes
to
branding
as
we
refocus
on
products
that
smell
and
that
do
not
rely
on
colors.
In
the
meantime,
we
commit
ourselves
to
innovation,
and
would
like
to
remind
you
with
the
below
post
to
always
be
innovating.

Hey
everyone,
admin
here
with
some
friendly
advice:
As
a
general
point
of
style,
try
to
refrain
from
posting
threads
in
the
format
of
X,
but
not
Y
or
X,
but
without
Y.
This
isn't
a
hard
and
fast
rule,
and
upon
reading
this,
don't
go
policing
every
thread
that's
ever
done
this,
but
when
you
find
yourself
doing
this,
go
the
extra
step
and
add
the
innovation.
For
example,
instead
of
Republicans,
but
not
stupid,
you
should
post:
Republicans,
but
instead
of
worshiping
the
invisible
hand
of
the
free
market,
they
believe
in
the
Invisible
Fist,
an
unbeatable
superhero
who
stalks
corporations
and
punches
them
into
providing
competitive
pricing
and
wages.

Your
unstoppable,
all-consuming,
indefatigable
drive
to
innovate,
24/7,
day
or
night,
has
been
truly
inspiring
and
wonderfully
synergetic.
To
sleep
even
for
a
second
is
to
miss
a
moment
of
potential
synergy.
It
completely
baffles
me
that
this
has
been
around
for
half
a
year
now,
and
that
you
pups
continue
to
show
up
and
make
me
laugh
every
day.
We
have
a
few
things
to
announce.
First,
the
mods
have
been
in
the
beginning
stages
of
planning
the
FIRST
ONE
SENTENCE
STARTUP
PITCHES
SYNNOVATION
SUMMIT,
which
will
take
place
in
New
York
City
a
couple
months
from
now.
There
will
be
some
totally
awesome
ideas
actualized
there
and
basically
we'll
publicize
the
shit
out
of
it
and
try
to
land
sponsorships
but
if
you
want
to
be
more
deeply
involved
in
planning,
let
us
know.
Alternatively,
if
you
have
ideas
for
events
or
things
we
should
have
at
the
summit,
you
can
post
them
under
the
tag
[#Synnovate].
Examples
of
things
we're
already
planning
on
doing
will
be
posted
in
the
comments
to
this
thread.
Second,
today,
you
can
feel
free
to
post
your
startup
pitches
as
normal.
However,
in
addition,
for
today
only,
you
can
post
things
that
already
exist
and
then
have
people
innovate
improvements
for
them
in
the
comments!
Which
means,
FOR
TODAY
ONLY,
you
can
tell
us
about
your
actual
real
life
startup,
provided
it's
in
one
sentence
or
less,
and
we
will
not
only
not
delete
it,
but
make
your
idea
better
IN
REAL
TIME.
As
Bunny
Colvin
once
proved,
the
best
way
to
stop
crime
is
to
make
it
legal.
Though
it
totally
doesn't
have
to
be
startups.
It
can
be
whatever
you
want!
So
keep
your
eyes
open!
We
have
big
plans
for
this
group.
MAY
THE
NEXT
5000
MEMBERS
AND
SIX
MONTHS
BE
AS
AWESOME
AS
THE
FIRST!

cholesteatoma
cases
to

says
Dr

free
operations.

and
Cambodia,
as
well
as
Bhutan
and
China.
Please,
read
again
the
sentence
With
his
work
in
Thailand
showing........
The
word
'show'
and
'watch'
don't
have
same
meaning.
'Show'
is
done
for
other
people,
while
the
work
'watch'
is
done
for
own
self.
The
word
'showing'
is
located
after
the
word
'Thailand'.
Can
I
write
With
his
work
in
Thailand
that
shows
results
.......?
Is
it
legal?
If
it
is
wrong,
what
are
the
reasons
behind
this?
I
think
'showing
result'
means
after
observing
results
of
his
works
in
Thailand,
Dr
Sal
wanted
to
spread
the
area
of
his
work
to
the
neighbouring
country
of
Thailand.
Am
I
right?
If
I
replace
the
word
'showing'
with
'watching'
or
'observing',
what
kind
of
differences
will
be
appeared?
