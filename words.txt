A
while

Harambe:

So
I
decided
to
start
writing
the
opening
number.
Tell
me
what
you
think:
How
does
a
primate,
simian,
Son
of
a
chimp
and
a
monkey,
Dropped
in
the

of

squalor,
somehow
take
bullets
from

posted
all
about
him.
And
every
day
while
kids
Went
to
the
zoo
to
see
what
animals
did
A
kid
fell
in
and
struggled
to
get
his
guard
up.
Inside,
he
was
longing
for
something
to
be
a
part
of
But
our
brother
grabbed
the
kid
and
started
to
drag
him
off.
Then
the
zoo
staff
came,
and
devastation
rained
Our
ape,
would
see
his
future
drip,
dripping
down
the
drain.
The
zookeeper
took
a
gun,
and
aimed
it
at
his
brain.
And
then
there
was
a
bang,
but
the
gorilla
felt
no
pain!
And
the
word
got
around,
they
said
this
shooting
is
insane
man!
He
travelled
through
the
internet
and
all
the
way
to
meme-land!
Get
yo'
face
on
t-shirts!
Don't
forget
from
whence
you
came!
And
the
World's
gonna
know
your
name.

lowland
gorilla.

rural
areas.
With
their
own
understanding
of
the
problem
along
with
the
currently
present
solutions/policies,
participants
should
work
on

optimal
solution.

happy,
grateful
newlywed.
I've
thrived
after
a
coma,
organ
failure,
sexual
abuse,
27
surgeries,
six
years
unable
to
eat
or
drink
and
the
PTSD
that
comes
from
ten
years
of
trauma.
To
heal,
I
created
a
one-woman
musical
about
it,
Gutless
&
Grateful,
which
explores
themes
of
resilience,
post-traumatic
growth,
and
much,
much,
much
unwavering
hope
and
optimism.
