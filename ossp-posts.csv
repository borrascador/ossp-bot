HOLY SHIT, WE'RE TWO.\n\nDespite tremendous changes to the meme climate, we've managed to grow 138%, outstripping all of our competitors, including TechCrunch Disrupt, Slashdot, and Gawker. With this growth, we now qualify for UNICORN STATUS. And most importantly, during this time we have completely and utterly changed the way that technology operates, with tremendous advances across all verticals, and the latest example happened just today, where through our efforts, private prisons were finally banned.\n\nI'm proud of all of us. \n\nThere's still work to be done. The vast majority of mobile applications still remain inaccessible to dogs, despite the advent of VR, and dogs remain horribly underrepresented on board seats. The Blue Engine looms, defeated but undead. And despite our best efforts, our birthday posts continue to be longer than one sentence.\n\nThese are goals I'm confident we can overcome. But today, we let our fur down.\n\nFrom now, until judgment at the end of September, we will be holding a COMPETITION.\n\nFor all of those interested in participating, the goal is this: Take your favorite OSSP post, and develop it into a video pitch (elevator pitch/shark tank style/kickstarter style/infomercial style - whatever you want.) At the end, the videos will be judged, and the winners honored on this page. \n\nMods are available to answer any questions regarding the competition.\n\nThank you all for participating in this wonderful fiscal year. Your weirdness drives this company, but it also drives my heart.""",b'Nicky Dover',b'Nicky',photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204513943792572&set=gm.1621445651406012&type=3',2016-08-18 14:26:08,254,18,0,230,18,1,5,0,0

My problem is word economy so I\'d love to figure out how to pull my business into a one sentence pitch!\nI\'m a survivor/warrior, artist, author, writer, health advocate, actress, and playwright. I\'m also a 28-year-old college kid and a very happy, grateful newlywed.   I\'ve ""thrived"" after a coma, organ failure, sexual abuse, 27 surgeries, six years unable to eat or drink and the PTSD that comes from ten years of trauma.  To heal, I created a one-woman musical about it, ""Gutless & Grateful,"" which explores themes of resilience, post-traumatic growth, and much, much, much unwavering hope and optimism. You can read a bit about my own journey here: https://www.amyoes.com/2015/08/09/how-losing-my-stomach-made-me-hungry-for-life/ and there is also a brief documentary on my story in the link.  I\'m also touring college campuses with a mental health awareness/sexual assault prevention program - https://www.amyoes.com/gutless/for-colleges/  My goal is to lead a retreat/online summit to help others thrive and cultivate resiliency.
